You have just started your first term as <PRESIDENT>, and as your Chief of Staff, I'm here to explain how things work. The icons below show you a few key indicators of the state of our country. Hopefully you can change things for the better, and get re-elected after your term is up! Press the button in the window below (marked ""Begin term of office"") to start governing..."

The icons represent different objects in the economy or society, including policies, laws, voter groups and values for important concepts such as health and education levels of our citizens. Click the next button."
#,2,VoterStrips,Voters,1,10,10,600,1,ClearHighlights(),Highlight(VOTERSTRIP);,"These strips in the center of the screen represent groups of voters, with the colored progress bars indicating how happy they are with your government. The light grey area behind the text shows the percentage of our electorate that is in each of these groups. One of the key concepts of Democracy 3 is to understand that individual voters can be members of many different voter groups at once, and the extent to which they identify with those groups is in itself variable. You will never get *all* of these voter groups to entirely approve of you."
#,3,PolicyIcons,Policies,1,10,10,600,1,ClearHighlights(),Highlight(POLICYICON);,"White icons are policies. You start the game with some already implemented, but most can be cancelled and many more can be added. They can also be adjusted. Policies are the primary method you use to govern the country."

They concern abstract concepts such as GDP (gross domestic product), crime or the education level of your citizens. You can affect statistical data only indirectly, through policy decisions.
