[option0]
Name = Introduce the ban
Description = School is a place for children to learn, not to display religious allegiance. By ensuring all students dress the same, we can ensure there is equality and integration of all religions, with no discrimination. This is the logical extension of the separation of religion and state. People are free to dress how they like in churches and mosques, but not in state schools.

[option1]
Name = Reject the ban
Description = This is nothing short of discrimination against Muslims. Nobody really expects this law to be used to prevent the wearing of Christian crosses, it exists purely as an excuse to ban Muslim students from dressing as they wish. This will cause division and segregation, and is a recipe for religious tension in schools.
