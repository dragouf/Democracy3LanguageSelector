Name = Ban it
Description = In this day and age there is no good reason to test any products on animals, especially cosmetics. The practices used are often incredibly cruel, and a ban would have widespread public support and little real impact on industry.

[option1]
Name = No change
Description = Products are only tested on animals in order to ensure there is no chance of danger to humans, and it's only done as a last resort under controlled conditions. If we impose such a drastic ban it will hit our cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries badly.
