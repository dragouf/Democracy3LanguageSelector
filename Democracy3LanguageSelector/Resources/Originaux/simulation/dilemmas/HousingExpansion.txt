[option0]
Name = Relax planning law
Description = House prices  are rising far faster than earnings, due mainly to the shortage of supply. In the long term, the only solution is to build more housing. It's no good providing housing where there are no jobs, and if that means building on a small proportion of 'green-belt' land then that's a price we have to pay.

[option1]
Name = Keep planning restrictions
Description = There is always pressure to build new homes on 'green field sites', because housing companies find it cheaper and easier to build on them. There are plenty of urban sites that should be reused before we resort to carving up the countryside. A sudden expansion into the green belt would have a dreadful impact on the rural communities.
