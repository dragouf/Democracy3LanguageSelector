[option0]
Name = Ban flag burning
Description = Many people are insulted by the thought of people burning the flag of their nation. The flag does not represent a specific political party, it represents the country itself. Burning the flag is a deeply unpatriotic act and anyone who would do such a thing should not be in this country in the first place.

[option1]
Name = Allow flag burning
Description = We cannot claim to be a free society whilst at the same time denying the right of people who oppose our government to express that view, even if that means burning the flag. At the end of the day, the flag is just a peace of cloth and how can we make it a criminal offence to burn a piece of cloth?
