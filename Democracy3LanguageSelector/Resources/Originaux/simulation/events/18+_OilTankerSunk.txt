Description = Breaking news! A large oil tanker has been sunk, the exact cause of which is unknown, but this will certainly, in the short term cause a drop in supplies of oil to us, and is therefore likely to push up oil prices. We can expect this to filter through to higher costs for motorists, as well as have some impact on the economy.
